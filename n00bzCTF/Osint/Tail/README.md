### Task

Here's a picture of a plane's tail. Can you find the airline's hub (the airport where they mostly operate from). Use the three letter airport IATA code and wrap it in n00bz{}. Example: n00bz{SFO}. Author: NoobMaster

### Solution

The first thing that comes to mind is to use a photo search. I tried to use Google's "Search by image" but I didn't find anything interesting. So I decided to search by photo in Yandex. Now we can see something helpful for us:

Google "Air Tahiti Nui":

In the logo we see a flower, so this is probably what we need.

Find the IATA code of hub (Fa'a'ƒÅ International Airport): PPT
