### Task

You may have gotten your first flag, but it's just the beginning! John Doe, as overconfident as he is, has left you with a riddle. Maybe it hides some secrets? Continue where you left off last time. Flag will already by wrapped in n00bz{} Author: NoobMaster

### Solution

Go to John Doe's page on the https://n00bzunit3d.xyz. There is an article "Who am I?".

You need to combine the first letters of each line into one sentence. Here it is "USERNAME IS JOHNHACKERDOE". Paste this username in namechk.com and see that there is a user with this nickname on twitter.

And you can see the flag on his profile.
